Let's consider the updated scenario with 60 males and 40 females in the dataset.

| Age | Gender | BP     | Chol   | Target   |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 25  | 1      | Low    | Low    | Healthy  |
| 45  | 0      | Normal | High   | Diseased |
| 35  | 1      | High   | Normal | Healthy  |
| 30  | 0      | Low    | Normal | Diseased |

With 4 features and 1 target variable, the decision tree algorithm needs more information to determine the first node (root node). It doesn't pick a random feature or split point. Here's what the algorithm typically does:

1. **Evaluate All Features:** The algorithm considers all four features you have in your dataset. It doesn't pre-select one based on any inherent order or bias.
2. **Impurity Measure Calculation:** For each feature, it calculates an impurity measure for all possible splits within that feature. Common impurity measures include Gini impurity (which you explained well) and information gain.
3. **Best Split Selection:** The algorithm then compares the impurity measures obtained for splits across all features. It chooses the feature and its corresponding split point that results in the **lowest impurity** (or highest information gain depending on the measure used). This becomes the first node (root node) of the decision tree.

In essence, the first node represents the most informative split based on the data, aiming to maximize the separation of target classes in the resulting child nodes.

Here's what you might still need to fully understand how the algorithm comes up with the first node:

- **Specific Impurity Measure:** Knowing the specific impurity measure used by the algorithm (Gini or information gain) can provide more insight into how it prioritizes splits.
- **Implementation Details:** The specific details of how the algorithm calculates impurity for each split can vary depending on the library or implementation you're using.



# How Decision Tree Splits Continues Features

Let's clarify the process for evaluating splits in a decision tree with a continuous feature, such as age, and how to determine the best split.

### Steps in Detail

### Example Dataset

Assume we have the following sorted dataset:

```
| Age | Target    |
|-----|-----------|
| 22  | Healthy   |
| 25  | Diseased  |
| 28  | Healthy   |
| 30  | Diseased  |
| 35  | Healthy   |
| 38  | Diseased  |
| 40  | Diseased  |
| 42  | Healthy   |
| 45  | Diseased  |
| 50  | Healthy   |

```

### Step 1: Sort the Data

Sort the dataset by the continuous feature (Age) in ascending order (already done).

### Step 2: Identify Potential Split Points

Potential split points are midpoints between consecutive unique values. These midpoints are:

Identify potential split points between consecutive unique values of the sorted feature. These are midpoints between consecutive ages.

For the sorted dataset, the potential split points are:

```
(22 + 25) / 2 = 23.5
(25 + 28) / 2 = 26.5
(28 + 30) / 2 = 29
(30 + 35) / 2 = 32.5
(35 + 38) / 2 = 36.5
(38 + 40) / 2 = 39
(40 + 42) / 2 = 41
(42 + 45) / 2 = 43.5
(45 + 50) / 2 = 47.5

```

Each midpoint is a candidate for splitting the data into two groups.

### Step 3: Calculate Gini Impurity for Each Split

For each potential split point, divide the dataset into two subsets and calculate the Gini impurity for each subset.

Assuming we decide to split the dataset based on Age <= 26.5 as the initial split:

### Step 1: Create the Initial Split

```
                [Age <= 26.5]
               /           \\
   [Yes]                   [No]
   /                      \\
[Healthy]             [Diseased]

```

- **Subset 1 (Age <= 26.5)**:

```
| Age | Target    |
|-----|-----------|
| 22  | Healthy   |
| 25  | Diseased  |
| 28  | Healthy   |

```

- **Subset 2 (Age > 26.5)**:

```
| Age | Target    |
|-----|-----------|
| 30  | Diseased  |
| 35  | Healthy   |
| 38  | Diseased  |
| 40  | Diseased  |
| 42  | Healthy   |
| 45  | Diseased  |
| 50  | Healthy   |

```

### Step 2: Calculate Gini Impurity for Each Subset

**Subset 1**:

- Healthy: 2
- Diseased: 1
- Total: 3

Gini Impurity Subset 1:
$[ Gini_1 = 1 - \left( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 \right) = 0.444 ]$

**Subset 2**:

- Healthy: 3
- Diseased: 4
- Total: 7

Gini Impurity Subset 2:
$[ Gini_2 = 1 - \left( \left( \frac{3}{7} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^2 \right) = 0.489 ]$

### Step 3: Calculate Weighted Gini Impurity

Calculate the weighted average Gini impurity for the split at Age <= 26.5.

Total samples in Subset 1 = 3
Total samples in Subset 2 = 7
Total samples in both subsets = 10

Weighted Gini Impurity:
$[ Gini_{\text{weighted}} = \left( \frac{3}{10} \times 0.444 \right) + \left( \frac{7}{10} \times 0.489 \right) = 0.466]$

```
            [Age <= 26.5]
           /           \\
			[Yes]             [No]
				/                 \
		[Healthy]             [Diseased]
		**gini 0.466**            **gini 0.489**
```

**This value (0.466) represents the overall impurity for the split on Age <= 26.5.**

After the first split on 26.5, the decision tree algorithm will continue to evaluate the remaining potential split points (23.5, 29, 32.5, 36.5, 39, 41, 43.5, and 47.5) and compute the weighted Gini impurity for each split.

You will now have a list of computed Gini impurities for each potential split on the Age feature. The algorithm will then select the split with the lowest Gini impurity as the next best split.

For example, let's say the computed Gini impurities for each potential split are:

| Split Point | Weighted Gini Impurity |
| --- | --- |
| 23.5 | 0.482 |
| 26.5 | 0.466 |
| 29 | 0.451 |
| 32.5 | 0.475 |
| 36.5 | 0.492 |
| 39 | 0.488 |
| 41 | 0.485 |
| 43.5 | 0.491 |
| 47.5 | 0.498 |
| … | … |

In this case, the algorithm would select the split at 29 (with a weighted Gini impurity of 0.451) as the next best split.

### Step 5: Select the Best Split

Select the split with the lowest Gini impurity. In this case, the split at Age <= 29 has the lowest weighted Gini impurity (0.451), so it will be chosen as the best split.

### Recursive Process

The decision tree algorithm will continue this process recursively:

- For each subset created by a split, it will identify potential split points, calculate the Gini impurity for each split, and select the best one.
- This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or achieving a minimum impurity decrease threshold (e.g., `min_impurity_decrease`).

This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum depth or a minimum improvement in impurity. The algorithm will recursively apply this process to each subset of data, exploring different features and split points to build a decision tree that minimizes the Gini impurity and maximizes the predictive power.





When dealing with a binary categorical feature like 'Gender' in a decision tree, the splitting process is simpler compared to continuous features. Here’s how it works:

1. **Encoding**:
    - Convert categorical variables into binary (one-hot encoding). For example, 'Gender' is converted into two binary columns: 'Gender_Male' and 'Gender_Female'.
2. **Evaluate Splits**:
    - For each binary column, calculate the proportion of '0' and '1'.
    - Determine the impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) for the split based on these proportions.
3. **Calculate Impurity**:
    - For each binary split (e.g., 'Gender_Male = 0' vs. 'Gender_Male = 1'), calculate the impurity for each subset created by the split.
    - Combine the impurities of the subsets to get the overall impurity for that split.
4. **Select the Best Split**:
    - Choose the split that results in the lowest impurity or highest information gain.

Let's consider the updated scenario with 60 males and 40 females in the dataset.

### Example Dataset

```
| Age | Gender | BP     | Chol   | Target   |
| --- | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 25  | 1      | Low    | Low    | Healthy  |
| 45  | 0      | Normal | High   | Diseased |
| 35  | 1      | High   | Normal | Healthy  |
| 30  | 0      | Low    | Normal | Diseased |

```

For simplicity, let's assume the following distribution:

- 60 Males: 40 Healthy, 20 Diseased
- 40 Females: 10 Healthy, 30 Diseased

### Split on `Gender = 1` (Male)

**Split 1: Gender = 1**

```
                [Gender = 1]
               /            \\
  [Yes, Gender = 1]    [No, Gender = 0]
     /                     \\

```

### Subsets after the split:

- **Subset 1 (Gender = 1, Male)**:

    ```
    Target values: 40 Healthy, 20 Diseased

    ```

- **Subset 2 (Gender = 0, Female)**:

    ```
    Target values: 10 Healthy, 30 Diseased

    ```


### Gini Impurity Calculation

1. **Calculate Gini impurity for each subset**:
    - **Subset 1 (Gender = 1, Male)**:
        - Proportion of 'Healthy': $( \frac{40}{60} = \frac{2}{3} )$
        - Proportion of 'Diseased': $( \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} )$
        - Gini impurity = $( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2\right) = 1 - \left(\frac{4}{9} + \frac{1}{9}\right) = 1 - \frac{5}{9} = \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.444 )$
    - **Subset 2 (Gender = 0, Female)**:
        - Proportion of 'Healthy': $( \frac{10}{40} = \frac{1}{4} )$
        - Proportion of 'Diseased': $( \frac{30}{40} = \frac{3}{4} )$
        - Gini impurity = $( 1 - \left(\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2\right) = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{16} + \frac{9}{16}\right) = 1 - \frac{10}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = 0.375 )$
2. **Calculate Weighted Gini Impurity for the Split**:
    - Total samples: 100
    - Weight of Subset 1:  $( \frac{60}{100} = 0.6 )$
    - Weight of Subset 2: $( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 )$
    - Weighted Gini impurity = $( (0.6 \times 0.444) + (0.4 \times 0.375) = 0.2664 + 0.15 = 0.4164 )$

### Conclusion

The weighted Gini impurity for the split on 'Gender' is approximately 0.4164. This value helps the decision tree algorithm determine whether splitting on 'Gender' is beneficial compared to other features, aiming to reduce the overall impurity in the resulting subsets.
